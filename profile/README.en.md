# ☕ Jprogram Java Projects

🌎 Leia em [Português](README.md)

Hello! 👋  

This is the space where I bring together my **Java** projects — applications, exercises, experiments, and utilities I’ve developed to put my studies into practice and explore new ideas.

## 🎯 About the Organization

I created **Jprogram-Java-Projects** to centralize everything I’ve been developing in Java.  

Here you’ll find everything from small logic exercises to more complete applications — all focused on learning, best practices, and continuous improvement.

My goals with this organization are to:
- Consolidate my Java portfolio  
- Have a space to version and improve my projects  
- Share what I learn along the way  
- (And maybe) inspire others who are also studying Java
